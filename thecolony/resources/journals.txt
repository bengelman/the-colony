Dear Jmishtin,
I made it to the triad base on Cacus, Vulcan's outermost moon. It's pretty great. I have state-of-the-art equipment and a room to myself. The people understand me here - I feel like I fit in. There are very few humans. I hope you can come visit me soon.
Love,
Devona

Case file - Stosthor Triad Haven base

Reports from locals suggest that the Stosthor Triad has a hidden base in Haven.
If reports are to be believed, this base is operating out of the old aircraft hangar. 
Scouts sent to location have not returned.
We are building a bunker in Haven. This bunker will be a facade so that we can build a secret tunnel to the Triad base.
